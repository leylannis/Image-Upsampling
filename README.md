## How To Run:
    Makefile provided simplifies compilation and running process.
    Once the codebase in this repository is downloaded, ensure googletest and gcov are installed in your home directory.
    The command options are listed and described below.

    "make"
        will compile main.cpp and produce the executable ./main
    "make test"
        will compile UnitTest.cpp and run unit tests
        will produce googletest output to the console accordingly
    "make coverage"
        will compile main.cpp for gcov to be run
        ensure "sample1_input_image.txt" is in your current directory
        will produce line coverage output to the console
